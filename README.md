# Spotify Plus
If you get into a mood, you want your music to reflect that. Spotify Plus is a react 
app that predicts the emotional musical mood that the user is in and alters their 
playlist to reflect that mood.  

### Project Goals
This project was started to learn the concept of nueral nets. Tensor flow is
Google's neural network framework. It allows for quick and accurate modeling of
nueral networks. Spotify Plus uses two nueral networks wherein the first analysizes 
sentiment of lyrics and the second analysizes song metrics from Spotify's API with the
sentiment to produce the emotional output of a given song.

### Getting Started

Then visit localhost:8080 and start listing out your favorite media... or maybe even make some changes and send them in!
